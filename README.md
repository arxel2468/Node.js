# Chat web application
Node.js is an open-source and cross-platform JavaScript runtime environment. It is a popular tool for almost any kind of project!  Node.js runs the V8 JavaScript engine, the core of Google Chrome, outside of the browser. This allows Node.js to be very performant.

I have made this Chat application because I was curious about how best I can make a chatting application but this is just a simple chat application
